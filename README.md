# Helix Sandbox

## About

Helix Sandbox is a Powered by FIWARE Platform that is fully compatible with FIWARE's Generic Enablers (GE). Its purpose is to simplify the process of installation, configuration and use of the GEs through an easy-to-use graphical interface that enables orchestration of the elements that constitute it. The platform is built on a microservice basis and uses Docker to perform the GE instantiation. Helix Sandbox can be installed on any Cloud or Virtualization Platform that enables the use of Linux virtual machines. In its internal architecture are present the Orion Context Broker, IoT Agent LWM2M CoAP DTLS, Cygnus, Helix dashboard and a MongoDB database to provide the temporal data storage. Helix Sandbox was designed for PoCs (Proofs of Concept), Startups MVPs (Minimal Viable Product), Students, Scientific Researches, and Experimental Applications based on FIWARE Technology using a few computational resources.
