# Helix sandbox 

## About

Helix Sandbox is an open platform that is fully compatible with FIWARE's Generic Enablers (GE). Its purpose is to simplify the process of installation, configuration and use of the GEs through an easy-to-use graphical interface that enables orchestration of the elements that constitute it. The platform is built on a microservice basis and uses Docker to perform the GE instantiation. Helix Sandbox can be installed on any Cloud platform or virtualization that enables the use of Linux virtual machines. In its internal architecture are present the Orion Context Broker, IoT Agent LWM2M Coap, Cygnus, Helix dashboard and a MongoDB database to provide the temporal storage of the data. It can be used to aid and accelerate the process of constructing PoCs (Proof of Concept) and experimental applications based on FIWARE with the use of few computional resources.

<br>

## Requirements before Helix sandbox installation

- You can use any local hypervisor like Virtual Box, VMware and KVM or if you need a global internet access we suggest any Cloud Service Provicer (CSP) like AWS, Azure or Google.
- Minimum server configuration: 1 vCPU, 1GB RAM and 16GB HDD or SSD.
- You can install any Linux distribution, but Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS has been validated exhaustively for us.
- You will need to open the ports in the Firewall if you decide to use CSP: 
```
22/TCP - SSH
5000/TCP - Web Interface
1026/TCP - Orion Contex Broker (HTTP or HTTPs)
27017/TCP - MongoDB "Historical Data Access"
5683/UDP - CoAP 
5684/UDP - CoAP with DTLS
```
- You must update and upgrade the server using sudo apt command:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```
- Install <b>Docker</b>: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/
- Install <b>docker-compose</b>: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
- Download the template images to prevent first-time delays deploying containers 

```
sudo docker pull mongo
sudo docker pull fiware/orion
sudo docker pull fiware/cygnus-ngsi
sudo docker pull m4n3dw0lf/dtls-lightweightm2m-iotagent
```
- If you want to use TLS/DTLS in the Orion and IoT Agents, you need to create a `/run/secrets` directory inside your host and populate with the certificate and key, you can generate a self-signed key-pair using the following command:
```
sudo mkdir -p /opt/secrets
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /opt/secrets/ssl_key -out /opt/secrets/ssl_crt
```

<br>

## Installing
<br>

Replace the aes_key with your own password and ssl key-pair with your valid key-pair if you don't want to use a self-signed.
```
echo "change_to_your_encryption_key" > secrets/aes_key.txt
```

```
git clone https://github.com/m4n3dw0lf/helix-sandbox
cd helix-sandbox/compose
sudo docker-compose up -d
```
<br>
## Updating

```
cd helix-sandbox
git pull
cd compose
sudo docker-compose down
rm -rf ../helix/app/db/helix.sqlite
sudo docker-compose up -d
```
## Access the Helix sandbox web interface

- You can use your preferred web browser
- Access: http://<HELIX_IP>:5000

- Setup the **admin** account

## Connecting to the Agent using the device

Walkthrough client found here: https://github.com/telefonicaid/lwm2m-node-lib

Run the following commands in the client:

```
create /3311/0                                  # Notice: Object ID
connect <HELIX_IP> 5683 rasp1 /light_control    # Notice: Device and Service names
set /3311/0 5850 On                             # Notice: Resource ID
```

### Query the device status on the FIWARE Orion Context Broker

--header "Content-Type:application/json" \
--header "Accept:application/json" \
-d '{
      "entities": [{
        "id" : "Device:rasp1"
      }]
    }'
```

```

## Viewing historical data in MongoDB 

```
docker exec -it broker1_mongodb mongo
> show dbs
admin                0.000GB
local                0.000GB
orion                0.000GB
orion-pressure_control  0.000GB
sth_pressure_control    0.000GB
```
The `sth_pressure_control` will hold collections with the historical data record got from the device.

You can use MongoDB Compass to view historical data https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass
